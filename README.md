| Greetings, I'm Patrick Lehmann, a Full-Stack Developer specializing in React, Next.js, React Native, GraphQL, and TypeScript. Originally from rural Brazil, now based in [**Berlin**](https://g.co/kgs/ECpcnmE "**Berlin**"), Germany. I'm passionate about UX design, AI, and crafting meaningful products. Previously at [**code-b**](https://code-b.com "code-b"), where I shipped projects like [ThePioneer.de](https://thepioneer.de/) and [Tabletop Herald](https://tabletop-herald.com/), designed mockups, prototypes, and implemented test-first, agile practices. When not coding, you'll find me exploring the city with my dog Ponyo or planning our next tent-and-van adventure. |![patrico](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1388224779912634371/n1lC4qgs_400x400.jpg)|
